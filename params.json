It is an example of how to apply Boost Graph Library algorithms to implicit graphs.\r\n\r\nThe solver consists of a single program called `astar-maze`.  This program generates a random maze and tries to find the shortest path from the lower left-hand corner to the upper right-hand corner.  Mazes are represented by two-dimensional grids where a cell in the grid may contain a barrier.  You may move up, down, right, or left into any adjacent cell that does not contain a barrier.\r\n\r\nOnce a maze solution has been attempted, the maze is printed.  If a solution was found it will be shown in the maze printout and its length will be returned.  Note that not all mazes have solutions.\r\n\r\nThe default maze size is 20x10, though different dimensions may be specified on the command line.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nYou must have the Boost Graph Library version 1.44 or higher installed.  Set `BOOST_PATH` in the Makefile to point to the root of your Boost include tree.  The `astar-maze` program builds in the distribution directory and does not install anywhere else on the system.\r\n\r\n\r\nImplementation\r\n==============\r\n\r\nThe maze is represented by the `maze` class.  This class has a [grid graph](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_41_0/libs/graph/doc/grid_graph.html \"Grid Graph\") member which defines the underlying grid.  All edges are assigned a weight of one.  Barriers in the maze are removed from the underlying grid using a [graph filter](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_43_0/libs/graph/doc/filtered_graph.html \"Filtered Graph\").  The maze is searched using the [A* search](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_38_0/libs/graph/doc/astar_search.html \"A* Search\") algorithm.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n=======\r\n\r\n* **Version 1.0.0**: Initial release\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright\r\n=========\r\n\r\nCopyright [W.P.
