        <h1>A-Star Maze Solver</h1>

<p>This program uses the A-star search algorithm in the <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_43_0/libs/graph/doc/index.html" title="Boost Graph Library">Boost Graph Library</a> to solve a maze.  It is an example of how to apply Boost Graph Library algorithms to implicit graphs.</p>

<p>The solver consists of a single program called <code>astar-maze</code>.  This program generates a random maze and tries to find the shortest path from the lower left-hand corner to the upper right-hand corner.  Mazes are represented by two-dimensional grids where a cell in the grid may contain a barrier.  You may move up, down, right, or left into any adjacent cell that does not contain a barrier.</p>

<p>Once a maze solution has been attempted, the maze is printed.  If a solution was found it will be shown in the maze printout and its length will be returned.  Note that not all mazes have solutions.</p>

<p>The default maze size is 20x10, though different dimensions may be specified on the command line.</p>

<h1>Installation</h1>

<p>You must have the Boost Graph Library version 1.44 or higher installed.  Set <code>BOOST_PATH</code> in the Makefile to point to the root of your Boost include tree.  The <code>astar-maze</code> program builds in the distribution directory and does not install anywhere else on the system.</p>

<h1>Implementation</h1>

<p>The maze is represented by the <code>maze</code> class.  This class has a <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_41_0/libs/graph/doc/grid_graph.html" title="Grid Graph">grid graph</a> member which defines the underlying grid.  All edges are assigned a weight of one.  Barriers in the maze are removed from the underlying grid using a <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_43_0/libs/graph/doc/filtered_graph.html" title="Filtered Graph">graph filter</a>.  The maze is searched using the <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_38_0/libs/graph/doc/astar_search.html" title="A* Search">A* search</a> algorithm.</p>
